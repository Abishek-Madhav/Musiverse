            "Harmony in twilight",
            "VERSE 1\nMy heart beats to the rhythm of a silent melody,\u266a\nEver since I met you on a shoreline of a dreamy sea,\u266b\nYour eyes, they dance with the magic of a starlit night,\u266d\nIn our perfect harmony, under the twilight.\u2669\n\n[CHORUS]\nCan you hear the music playing in the wind?\u266c\nThe harmonies of the heart, where love begins.\u266c\nDon't overlook the symphony of the night,\u266e\nIn our perfect harmony, everything is right.\u2669\n\nVERSE 2\nThe glow of the moon is our symphonic orchestra,\u266a\nPlaying tunes that set our passionate hearts free,\u266b\nOur footsteps in the sand, a tempo of delight,\u266d\nIn our perfect harmony, under the twilight.\u2669\n\n[CHORUS]\nCan you feel the rhythm pulsing within our hearts?\u266c\nThe melodies in the moment, as this dance starts.\u266c\nIn the wonder of the symphony of the night,\u266e\nIn our perfect harmony, everything is right.\u2669\n\nBRIDGE (OPTIONAL)\nIn the cord of the universe, we struck a note true,\u266a\nCrafting songs of love, in hues of vivid blue.\u266b\nA melody that's ordained as timeless, \u266a\nEternally played, our love is rhymeless.\u266b\n\n[CHORUS]\nOur heartbeat is the rhythm, our song is the night,\u266c\nIn this perfect melody, love is in sight.\u266c\nIn the grandeur of the symphony of the night,\u266e\nIn our perfect harmony, everything is right.\u2669"
